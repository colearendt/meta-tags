# meta-tags

Do you know how Slack, iMessage, and lots of other applications present links in
a "pretty" fashion that gives you a preview of the content on the linked page?

`meta-tags`! Yes!! In the HTML for that page, there is an array of `<meta>` HTML
tags that give important information enabling these previews.

So what tags exist? I'm sure there are articles on that... but I wanted to see for myself.

Cue HTML scraping! Some simple little tools to pull the `meta` tags for a given URL.

## Some Examples
